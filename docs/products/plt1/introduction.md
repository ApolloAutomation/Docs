The PLT-1 uses a capacitive soil moisture sensor, which offers much better accuracy and durability compared to resistive sensors. Additionally, the ground contact portion is protected with a conformal coating, ensuring longevity and resistance to environmental factors.

### Sensors:

\- Capacitive Soil Moisture
