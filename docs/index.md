### **What is Apollo Automation?**

Apollo Automation is a small startup building home automation hardware that is quality, affordable, and community driven. We host monthly live streams in our <a href="https://discord.gg/mMNgQPyF94 " target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>. Apollo Automation started as a small side project for a group of friends in Lexington, KY USA. Named after Trevor's dog <a href="https://apolloautomation.com/pages/our-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo</a> we built our first sensor due to frustration with the offerings at the time. Apollo Automation quickly grew from a side project to a real deal. We still and always will maintain our core premisses: Building our products ourselves instead of outsourcing, being transparent and available, and working with the community.

### **What do we offer?**

We strive to build quality products that solve some problem in Home Automation. We strive to innovate instead of simply copy, and we offer some of the best support in the industry. We are a small agile team hyper focused on growing our community of users and manufacturing capabilities
