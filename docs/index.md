### **What is Apollo Automation?**

Apollo Automation is a small startup focused on building high-quality, affordable, and community-driven home automation hardware. We host monthly livestreams on our Discord channel. Apollo Automation began as a side project for a group of friends in Lexington, KY, USA, and was named after Trevor’s dog, Apollo. Our first sensor was created out of frustration with the products available at the time. Since then, Apollo Automation has grown from a side project into a full-fledged business. We remain committed to our core values: building our products in-house rather than outsourcing, staying transparent and accessible, and collaborating closely with the community.

### **What do we offer?**

We strive to build quality products that solve real problems in home automation. Our focus is on innovation rather than imitation, and we’re proud to offer some of the best support in the industry. As a small, agile team, we are deeply committed to growing our community of users and expanding our manufacturing capabilities.
